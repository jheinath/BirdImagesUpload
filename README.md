# BirdImagesUpload

Just a small C# .NET Core Forms Application to configure a sync to my private Google Drive.

Current situation is, that a pair of birds is neesting on my balcony. My Raspberry Pi takes pictures of the birds every 20 seconds and save them locally.
This programm will publish the images to my cloud so I can see what the birds are doing while not beeing at home.

Here some information about the bird: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_kestrel

Here some photos:

UPDATE:

Stopped this project because I found a cool solution to capture the birds: https://www.yawcam.com/
With yawcam I could easily create a live stream and capture a photo of the live stream every 10th second.
Combined with Ngrok I was able to access the live stream from anywhere :)

Meanwhile 2 of the eggs hatched and both of them stayed one month in with their parents and then flew away in the open world.

Currently I am editing a timelapse of all the images taken by yawcam and will upload the result on YouTube.
