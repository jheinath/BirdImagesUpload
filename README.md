# BirdImagesUpload

Just a small C# .NET Core Forms Application to configure a sync to my private OneDrive.

Current situation is, that a pair of birds is neesting on my balcony. My Raspberry Pi takes pictures of the birds every 20 seconds and save them locally.
This programm will publish the images to my cloud so I can see what the birds are doing while not beeing at home.

Here some information about the bird: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_kestrel

Here some photos:
